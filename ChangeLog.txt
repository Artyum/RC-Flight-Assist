v1.31
- Fixed parameter filter=1
- Added parameter hlowlimit in rcfa.ini

v1.2d
- Update for GPS command protocol. Compatible with uBlox series 5, 6, 7, M8 and GlobalTop MT3318, MT3329, MT3339.
- Optimized GPS data capture.
- Added logging of minimal and maximal number of active sattelites during flight on GPS Logger close. Available at log level 1.
- Added logging of every active sattelites count while the GPS Logger is running. Available at log level 4.
- Added log message "GPS module lost" in case of loss connection to the GPS module. Available at log level 4.
- Slighty increased transmission power of initial signals (configuration, reference position etc.).
- RCFA RX v1.2d1 - Slightly diversified pitch of tones "too close" (single tone higher pitch) and "too far" (double tone lower pitch)

v1.2c
- Fixed interference between devices working on different channels.
- Added delay (1-2 sec) after GPS fix recover to minimize the possibility of getting wrong position.
- Points P1 and P2 are now saved in the memory in situation when Flight Area is read from rcfa.ini and new Flight Area is set with A and B buttons.

v1.2b
- Fixed problem with reading data from memory, which in some circumstances, cause the device to reboot.
- Fixed memory reset function (test=2).

v1.2a
- The sound "Invalid GPS fix" will be played only during aerobatic flight (when the Flight Area is locked).
- Fixed corrupted kml output.
- Fixed saving wrong P1 and P2 coordinates after Area Lock.
- The "test" parameter in rcfa.ini behaviour upgrade. It is now possible to quickly check the Flight Area specified by parameters p1lat, p1lon, p2lat, p2lon.
  test=0 - Normal system operation
  test=1 - Firmware test enabled. If points p1 and p2 are set in rcfa.ini the system will create a kml file regarding given coordinates and other options (dist, angle, refalt etc)
           If points p1 and p2 are not set, the system will create a test kml file with Flight Area on Mount Everest
  test=2 - Reset points P1 and P2 in internal system memory.
- Slower LED initialization status blinking.
- More debug messages during RX initialization - available through UART.
- Fixed RX red LED status when txpos=0.

v1.2
- FHSS implemented.
- In automatic mode, GPS Logger won't stop/start if airplane crosses far end of Flight Area, prevents creating of a new kml file.
- "No connection" sound disabled (instead there is silence).

v1.1c
- Improved SD I/O - fixed problem with corrupted kml files.
- Added test=2 to reset P1 and P2 in internal memory.
- Improved Flight Area saving function.
- Improved firmware check function.

v1.1
Initial firmware release.
